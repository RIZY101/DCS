Request protocol messages will always recieve a response protocol message. Responses may or may not recieve their own response depending on what it is.

Requests:

Add to list adds a client to the master nodes list of nodes
ATL storageInGB (Node -> MasterNode)

Remove from list removes the node from the master nodes list of nodes
RFL nodeId key (Node -> MasterNode)

Node allows the node to ask the master node for a node that can store its data
NODE storageNeedInGB(Node -> MasterNode)

Updated allows the node to update their IP in the list on the master node because ISP's are lame and dont give us static IPV6's yet
UPDATE nodeId key (Node -> MasterNode)

Checks the master node to see if an ip was updated
CHECK nodeId oldIp(Node -> MasterNode)

Store allows a node to store data on another node as long as its online note this key is different from the key given by masternode otherwise this new node could update the other nodes IP which is not good
STORE nodeId key2 dataSizeInBits (Node1 -> Node2)

A request from node1 to retrieve its data from node2
RETRIEVE nodeId key2 (Node1 -> Node2)

A request from node1 for node2 to delete all its data
REMOVE nodeId key2 (Node1 -> Node2)

Responses:

Confirmation that they were added to the list because certain IP's may be blacklisted and their nodeid plus a key so that they can update their ip in the future
ATLR yesOrNo nodeId key (MasterNode -> Node)

A response for whether or not the master node removed the node from the list
RFLR yesOrNo (MasterNode -> Node)

Response from MasterNode containing the IP of the new Node the requester should store their data at
NODER ipOfNewNode nodeId (MasterNode -> Node)

Response that confirms if the nodes IP was updated
UPDATER yesOrNO (MasterNode -> Node)

Response that validates whether or not its ready for all the data 
STORER yesOrNo (Node2 -> Node1)

A response from node2 with node1's data if their key was valid
RETRIEVER yesOrNo dataSizeInBits (Node2 -> Node1)

A response from node 2 to node 1 on whether their data was removed or not
REMOVER yesOrNo (Node2 -> Node1)

Response fro Check the master node to see if an ip was updated
CHECKR yesOrNo ip (MasterNode -> Node) ***Returns 0.0.0.0 if the ip didnt change for parsing ***

***Please note we are not concerned that keys are being sent in plain text over the protocol given that the messaging is encrypted over TLS***
